# Playervaults-Skript
spigot:
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playervaults.128507/

this is a skript for player vaults, you may edit this as you like but please don't remove the top part it should work on all versions where skript and skbee works the same as it is on my server i'm sure it works on 1.21.4-1.21.6

features:
it's all in small caps font (i personally think it looks good)
permissions for the amount of vaults someone can have
tab completion
some more i forgot idk it was a long time since i made this

dependencies:
skript (of course)
Skbee
